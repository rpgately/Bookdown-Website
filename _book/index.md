# About

This website is a collection of examples of graphs and tables (and the code to create them) that people have previously created in an attempt to alleviate some of the heartache that goes into creating academic graphs in R. Most have come from examples of research into kidney disease and have gone into academic papers (or tried to get in at least).

If you have examples of graphs/tables/code that you think would be useful to others please email me and supply a reproducible example (reprex) and we will add it to the website.

Ryan,
