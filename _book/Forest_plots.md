# Forest plots

## When model not developed in R

### Colour version

The following graphs were created using GGplot when the base model was not created in R (i.e., all you have is an excel file or CSV file of estimates and confidence intervals because your mate Billy asked you to make him a graph but your mate Billy still insists on using Microsoft Excel despite you repeatedly telling him how good R is).


```r
# Loading the necessary packages
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)
library(magrittr)
library(janitor)
```

This just creates a test dataset - just copy and paste the code below to create the dataset necessary for our example graph.


```r
test_data <- tribble(
        ~term, ~estimate, ~conf.low, ~conf.high,      ~level,
     "Weight",         1,         1,          1,     "Heavy",
     "Weight",      1.37,      1.06,       1.79,     "Light",
     "Height",         1,         1,          1,  "Middlin'",
     "Height",      6.91,       2.3,      20.79,     "Short",
     "Height",     15.26,       1.8,      129.5,      "Tall",
        "Age",         1,         1,          1,       "Old",
        "Age",      3.02,      1.78,       5.12,  "Middlin'",
        "Age",      5.97,      2.19,      16.27,     "Young",
      "Girth",         1,         1,          1,      "Wide",
      "Girth",      1.63,      1.27,       2.08,    "Narrow",
        "Sex",      0.98,      0.96,          1,      "Male"
     )
```

This code sets global options to apply to all parts of the example graph.


```r
theme_set(
  theme_minimal # Setting the default theme to base settings on
  (
    base_family = "Times", # Setting default font
    base_size = 8
  ) # Setting font size
)
```

Running the code to get the actual graph. The code is quite long as I have merged the estimates and confidence interval variables into a single variable use to label the graph at the end, havenâ€™t been able to find a way to do this in a more elegant and concise way.


```r
test_data %>%
  mutate(level = fct_reorder(level, desc(estimate))) %>% # To get the levels in order of strength of point estimate
  unite("confidence_intervals",
    conf.low, conf.high,
    remove = FALSE,
    sep = ", "
  ) %>% # This step (and the next unite and mutate) creates a new variable containing point estimate and CIs, necessary for one of the steps below
  mutate(
    confidence_intervals =
      paste0("(", confidence_intervals, ")")
  ) %>%
  unite("estimate_confidence_intervals",
    estimate, confidence_intervals,
    remove = F,
    sep = " "
  ) %>%
  mutate(estimate_confidence_intervals = case_when(
    conf.low == 1 ~ "", TRUE ~ estimate_confidence_intervals
  )) %>% # This step gets rid of the estimates and CIs from the reference levels (converting to NA doesn't work)
  ggplot(aes(x = level, y = estimate, ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(col = level), size = 0.2, shape = 1) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, linetype = "dotted", color = "grey40") +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("OR (95% Confidence Interval)") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high, col = level), width = 0.2, cex = 0.2) +
  facet_wrap(term ~ ., strip.position = "left", nrow = 10, scales = "free_y") +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log10") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold"),
    axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = 0.2, lineheight = 0.2),
    axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = 0.2),
    panel.background = element_blank(),
    panel.spacing.y = unit(0.5, "null"),
    strip.text.y = element_text(hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0, angle = 90, face = "bold"),
    legend.position = "none"
  ) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Odds ratios (logarithmic scale)") +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = estimate_confidence_intervals), # what you want to label with, this is the variable we created above
    family = "serif", # font
    size = 2.5, # Size of text of label
    nudge_x = 0.35, # Nudge label up and down
    nudge_y = .15, # Nudge label left and right
    min.segment.length = Inf, # This removes the annoying lines that join labels to their point
    xlim = c(-Inf, Inf), # These two limit lines prevent labels being repelled by boundaries of graph
    ylim = c(-Inf, Inf)
  )
```

### B&W version

Only very minor changes to the code above


```r
test_data %>%
  mutate(level = fct_reorder(level, desc(estimate))) %>% # To get the levels in order of strength of point estimate
  unite("confidence_intervals",
    conf.low, conf.high,
    remove = FALSE,
    sep = ", "
  ) %>% # This step (and the next unite and mutate) creates a new variable containing point estimate and CIs, necessary for one of the steps below
  mutate(
    confidence_intervals =
      paste0("(", confidence_intervals, ")")
  ) %>%
  unite("estimate_confidence_intervals",
    estimate, confidence_intervals,
    remove = F,
    sep = " "
  ) %>%
  mutate(estimate_confidence_intervals = case_when(
    conf.low == 1 ~ "", TRUE ~ estimate_confidence_intervals
  )) %>% # This step gets rid of the estimates and CIs from the reference levels (converting to NA doesn't work)
  ggplot(aes(x = level, y = estimate, ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  geom_pointrange(size = 0.2, shape = 1) +

    ylim = c(-Inf, Inf)
  )
```

## When model object available

This is a test to see if this is working, I am not sure it is
